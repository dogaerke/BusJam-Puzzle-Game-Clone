BusJam Game Clone was developed during our long-term internship at Marker Games. This project is a 3D mobile game where players aim to level up by matching same-colored characters with corresponding vehicles. The development was undertaken by me and a teammate, involving scripting in Unity Editor, level design, implementing a grid system, and integrating the A* pathfinding algorithm for gameplay mechanics.


I developed,
1. Grid system
2. A* pathfinding algorithm
3. Changing camera position according to levels

# Busjam Puzzle Game Clone

We developed this game with a teammate during our long-term internship at Marker Games. This project is a 3D mobile game where players aim to level up by matching same-colored characters with corresponding vehicles. The development was undertaken by me and a teammate, involving scripting in Unity Editor, implementing a grid system, and integrating the A* pathfinding algorithm for gameplay mechanics and level design.
